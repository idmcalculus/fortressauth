# FortressAuth Angular Example - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and update the values as needed.
#
# NOTE: Angular uses environment.ts files for configuration instead of .env files.
# To change the API URL:
#   - Development: Edit src/environments/environment.ts
#   - Production: Edit src/environments/environment.prod.ts
#
# The values below are for reference and documentation purposes.

# API URL - The URL of your FortressAuth server
# Update the apiUrl in src/environments/environment.ts for development
# Update the apiUrl in src/environments/environment.prod.ts for production
# Default: http://localhost:5001 (local development server)
API_URL=http://localhost:5001

# CORS Configuration Note:
# The FortressAuth server must have this origin in its CORS_ORIGINS configuration.
# For local development, the server allows localhost:5173 and localhost:5174 by default.
# Angular typically runs on localhost:4200, so you may need to add it to the server's CORS_ORIGINS.
#
# Example server configuration:
# CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:4200,http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
#
# The Angular SDK automatically includes credentials: 'include' in all fetch requests,
# which is required for cookie-based authentication to work across origins.
