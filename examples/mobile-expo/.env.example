# FortressAuth Expo (React Native) Example - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and update the values as needed.

# API URL - The URL of your FortressAuth server
# This is used by the FortressAuth SDK to make authentication requests.
#
# IMPORTANT: For local development with a physical device or emulator,
# use your machine's local IP address instead of localhost.
# The mobile device/emulator cannot reach localhost on your development machine.
#
# To find your local IP:
#   - macOS/Linux: ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
#   - Windows: ipconfig | findstr /i "IPv4"
#
# Example: http://192.168.1.100:5001
# Default: http://localhost:5001 (only works in web browser)
#
# Note: You can also configure the API URL in app.json under "extra.apiUrl"
# which takes precedence over this environment variable.
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001

# CORS Configuration Note:
# The Expo/React Native SDK uses Bearer token authentication instead of cookies,
# so CORS cookie handling doesn't apply. Tokens are stored securely using expo-secure-store.
#
# For mobile apps, CORS is typically not an issue since native HTTP clients
# don't enforce browser CORS restrictions. However, when running in Expo web mode,
# the server needs to allow the origin (usually localhost:8081 or localhost:19006).
