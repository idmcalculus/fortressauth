# FortressAuth Svelte Example - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and update the values as needed.

# API URL - The URL of your FortressAuth server
# This is used by the FortressAuth SDK to make authentication requests.
# Default: http://localhost:5001 (local development server)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001

# CORS Configuration Note:
# The FortressAuth server must have this origin in its CORS_ORIGINS configuration.
# For local development, the server allows localhost:5173 and localhost:5174 by default.
# If using a different port, add it to the server's CORS_ORIGINS environment variable.
#
# Example server configuration:
# CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5174,http://localhost:3000
#
# The Svelte SDK automatically includes credentials: 'include' in all fetch requests,
# which is required for cookie-based authentication to work across origins.
