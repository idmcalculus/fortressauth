# FortressAuth Electron (Desktop) Example - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and update the values as needed.

# API URL - The URL of your FortressAuth server
# This is used by the FortressAuth SDK to make authentication requests.
# Default: http://localhost:5001 (local development server)
FORTRESSAUTH_API_URL=http://localhost:5001

# Node environment (development or production)
# In development mode, DevTools will open automatically.
# Set to "production" for release builds.
NODE_ENV=development

# CORS Configuration Note:
# The Electron SDK uses Bearer token authentication instead of cookies,
# so CORS cookie handling doesn't apply. Tokens are stored securely using electron-store.
# However, the server still needs to allow the origin for preflight requests.
#
# For Electron apps, CORS is typically not an issue since the app runs locally
# and makes requests directly to the server without browser CORS restrictions.
